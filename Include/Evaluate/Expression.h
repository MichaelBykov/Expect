/// Define a custom comparison used in testing.
/// \param type
///   The type for which to define a custom comparison.
/// \param mode
///   The comparison mode.
///   Should be one of the following options:
///   `Exact`, `Approx`, `Near`, `Within`.
/// \param comparison
///   The comparison type to define.
///   Should be one of the following options:
///   `Value`, `Equal`, `NotEqual`, `Less`, `LessEqual`, `Greater`,
///    `GreaterEqual`, `Range`, `InclusiveRange`, `ExclusiveRange`.
/// \remarks
///   Example usage:
///   ```
///   TEST_CUSTOM_COMPARE(int, Exact, Value) {
///     return value != 0;
///   }
///   
///   TEST_CUSTOM_COMPARE(double, Within, Equal) {
///     double x = lhs - rhs;
///     return x * x < tolerance * tolerance;
///   }
///   
///   TEST_CUSTOM_COMPARE(int, Exact, InclusiveRange) {
///     return lhs <= value && value <= rhs;
///   }
///   
///   TEST_CUSTOM_COMPARE(int, Exact, Range) {
///     if (lhsIncluded && rhsIncluded)
///       return lhs <= value && value <= rhs;
///     else if (lhsIncluded)
///       return lhs <= value && value < rhs;
///     else if (rhsIncluded)
///       return lhs < value && value <= rhs;
///     else
///       return lhs < value && value < rhs;
///   }
///   ```
///   
///   For the `Value` comparison, there is one member to compare, `value`.
///   For the `Equal`, `NotEqual`, `Less`, `LessEqual`, `Greater`, and
///   `GreaterEqual` comparisons, there are two members to compare, `lhs` and
///   `rhs`.
///   For the `InclusiveRange` and `ExclusiveRange` comparisons, there are three
///   members to compare, `lhs`, `value`, and `rhs`, where `lhs` and `rhs` are
///   the left and right bounds of the range, respectively, and `value` is the
///   value being tested for being within the range.
///   The `Range` comparison has five members to compare, the three mentioned
///   for the range comparisons above in addition to `lhsIncluded` and
///   `rhsIncluded` which are booleans that indicate whether or not the left
///   and right ends of the range are included in the comparison.
///   Note that all three of the range specializations automatically adapt to
///   comparison specializations made in `Less`, `LessEqual`, `Greater`, and
///   `GreaterEqual`, therefore making a custom range comparison specialization
///   shouldn't be necessary oftentimes.
///   
///   If the comparison mode is `Approx`, `Near`, or `Within`, there is a
///   further member `tolerance` that indicates the tolerance in comparing two
///   values.
///   
///   The `Exact` comparison mode tests whether the value(s) are exactly within
///   their bounds.
///   For example, in exact comparison the expression `1.0 == 1.0000000001`
///   would evaluate to false.
///   
///   The `Approx` comparison mode tests whether the value(s) are relatively
///   within their bounds with relative equality at zero failing for all
///   non-zero values.
///   For example, in approximate comparison the expression `0.0 == 1e-50` with
///   a tolerance of `1e-6` would fail.
///   The expressions `1.0 == 1.02` and `1.0 == 1.03` with a tolerance of `0.01`
///   would succeed and fail, respectively.
///   The equation for approximate equality is `|x - y| < tol * |x + y|` and for
///   approximately less is `x - y < tol * |x + y|` where `x` and `y` are the
///   left-hand-side and right-hand-side comparison arguments, respectively,
///   and `tol` is the approximate comparison tolerance.
///   
///   The `Near` comparison mode tests whether the value(s) are relatively
///   within their bounds with relative equality at zero to be within the set
///   tolerance.
///   For example, in near comparison the expression `0.0 == 1.05` with a
///   tolerance of `0.1` would succeed while `0.0 == 1.15` would fail.
///   The expressions `1.0 == 1.02` and `1.0 == 1.03` with a tolerance of `0.01`
///   would succeed and fail, respectively.
///   The equation for near equality is `|x - y| < tol * max(1, |x + y|)` and
///   for nearly less is `x - y < tol * max(1, |x + y|)` where `x` and `y` are
///   the left-hand-side and right-hand-side comparison arguments, respectively,
///   and `tol` is the near comparison tolerance.
///   
///   The `Within` comparison mode tests whether the value(s) are within a fixed
///   tolerance.
///   For example, in within comparison the expression `0.0 == 1.05` with a
///   tolerance of `0.1` would succeed while `0.0 == 1.15` would fail.
///   The expressions `1.0 == 1.05` and `1.0 == 1.15` with a tolerance of `0.1`
///   would succeed and fail, respectively.
///   The equation for within equality is `|x - y| < tol` and for within less is
///   `x - y < tol` where `x` and `y` are the left-hand-side and right-hand-side
///   comparison arguments, respectively, and `tol` is the comparison tolerance.
///   
///   If you are using a custom comparison of a type in more than one file, make
///   sure to define the specialization in a shared header, for example,
///   `TEST_CUSTOM_COMPARE(int, Exact, Value);` for the first specialization in
///   the above example, to avoid duplicate code errors when compiling.
